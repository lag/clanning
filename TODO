Things I need to fix/add, but aren't top priority:
- Note Builder:
    - Allow for building level to be marked as upgraded and for a note of a new upgrade starting with proper new level.
    - Take gold/elixir/dark elixir capacity into account when a building that stores some is marked as upgraded in note.
    - Add walls with level selection. (wall section added, just need to add upgrading / adding new walls)
    - Catch cases where nothing is in the village and trying to add both village/builder will clash on ids. (no pun intended)
    - When making an updated time based on gems, the "x time ago" is reset to the second of the update.
    - Add support to town hall weapon level upgrades.
    - If there is a pending new building being built it won't add in the new id creation for other new buildings.
    - Bulk import buildings with scan (WIP -- just need to increase accuracy of image recognition)
- Player Page:
    - Break this entire page up into components. It's getting too big.
    - Make all pulling of historical, current, and building data more efficient (do not do different calls and reads for each).
    - When a new player is added, give them all required buildings and troops for their town hall level (or hint at them to be added in bulk -- currently has to be done manually).
    - Add dark elixir storages.
- History
    - Add working diffs for clan information. (not done because my alt is not yet in a clan)
- Codebase
    - Need to refactor a lot of it. Clean up all the template and messiness that has arisen. (I blame Claude.)
