Things I need to fix/add, but aren't top priority:
- Note Builder:
    - Allow for building level to be marked as upgraded and for a note of a new upgrade starting with proper new level.
- Player Page:
    - Make all pulling of historical, current, and building data more efficient (do not do different calls and reads for each).
    - When a new player is added, give them all required buildings and troops for their town hall level (or hint at them to be added in bulk -- currently has to be done manually).
    - Add dark elixir storages.
    - Add builder_base information. (haven't unlocked it on my alt so not testing yet.)
